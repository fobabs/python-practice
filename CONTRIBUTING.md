## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fobabs/python-practice/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [hi@fobabs.com](mailto:hi@fobabs.com).


## I Want To Contribute

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the resource or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a [new Issue](https://github.com/fobabs/python-practice/issues/new), a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/fobabs/python-practice/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.


### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

**Happy Exploring!!** :fire:
